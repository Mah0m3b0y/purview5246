Asset_Baseline adjustment	Baseline adjustment	Draft	"- A baseline adjustment can be created using implementation file upload or AD adjustment file upload
Let's say our system calculates the depreciation up to a specific point (eg: 12/31/2021) as $5000. But the implementation file reports that the depreciation up to 12/31/2021 is $6000.
In this scenario, we add a baseline adjustment of the difference amount which is $1000 on 12/31/2021.
And then we revert this baseline adjustment in the next month. This means that we post -$1000 on 1/31/2021.
Baseline adjustment can also be a negative amount. The reversal would be a positive amount in that case
